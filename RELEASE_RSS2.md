Release: RSS2 feed
===================

This branch publishes an RSS2 feed alongside the existing Atom feed.

- Files generated by `fetch_stock_feed.py`: `docs/feed.atom` (Atom) and `docs/feed.rss` (RSS2).
- Both feeds are kept in sync by the script; CI commits changes in `docs/`.

This PR only adds this release note; the feed generator already writes RSS2.
